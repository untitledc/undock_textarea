----------

Your textarea is under attack!  Hover over the textarea and click on "lift off" button, and it will fly and stay in the viewport even when the page is scrolled.  You can also drag it around.  When you click on the cancel button, the textarea goes back to where it used to be before lifting.

It's useful when you have to read some comments at the bottom of the page in order to type something at the top without scrolling back and forth.
